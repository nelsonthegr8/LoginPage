********* This is the Explanation to the User Log On Java Application i made and the reason i coded it as such

Starting with the LogIn class

I decided to structure the login with panels because, they are easy to add and remove with the following lines of code: panel.removeAll(); panel.add(); panel.validate(); and panel.repaint();
panel.repaint(): is the main ingredient to get the screen to refresh with the new panel if you just type panel.removeAll(); panel.add(); panel.validate(); IT WILL NOT refresh the screen. you need .repaint();

so the login class is the starting point to all of the page flipping. Information class holds all the info and is the brains and data storer for the application.
AddUsr class is just another option i threw at the usr to make a new account in my "database" so what it does is collects the usrs usrname input, password input, about me and the picture they choose to upload 
and sends it to the information class to get stored and later used if they log on with that usrname and password.
the homepanel has a series of panels in there witch get flipped through after the user successfully logs into their account witch show the premisis of my aplication there about me and picture and allows them to 
log out.
